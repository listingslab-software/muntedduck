## [Cannastore](https://cannastore.app/). The World's First Cannabis Mobile App

![Cannastore](https://cannastore.app/logo32.png "Cannastore")

### Why? 

Because it's a [Progressive Web App](https://listingslab.com/work/javascript/pwa) which means it does not have to be installed via an App Store. The App Stores don't allow Apps about Cannabis.
